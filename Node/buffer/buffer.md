👉🏻 What is the Buffer Module?
    The Buffer module in Node.js is used to handle binary data.

    Buffers are similar to arrays of integers but are fixed-length and correspond to raw memory allocations outside the V8 JavaScript engine.

    Node.js provides the Buffer class as a global object, so you don't need to require or import it explicitly.
