# WTF-Backend 🚀

A personal backend-learning repository (**WTF – Walk Through Fundamentals**) built while following **Jonas Schmedtmann’s Complete Node.js, Express & MongoDB Bootcamp**.

This repo is a **learning playground**, not a production-ready project. It contains experiments, notes, and mini-practice files as I progress through backend development concepts.
